## Download update

As on your initial download, updates will be on the FiveM Keymaster. Inside the section "Granted Assets" you will find the asset named "Unlimited.wtf - Spectre".

1. Delete the folders **client**, **server** and **html** inside your old resource.
2. Insert the new folders "client", "server" and "html" from the downloaded resource.
3. Check if the `config.json` includes new values compared to your old one
4. Restart `unlimited-spectre`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Its recommended to do a full server restart instead of a resource restart.
