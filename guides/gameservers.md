# ðŸŽ® Gameservers

Mostly gameservers dont offer the additonal port, spectre needs. Check the following guides to use our webpanel on your gameserver.

## [ZAP-Hosting](https://zap-hosting.com/)

You need to navigate to your gameserver settings in the zap webpanel. At the bottom of the settings you will find following part.

Check the "Additional Port" sections. Choose one free port.

Inside our `config.json` now adjust your settings:

```
"port": "30432"
```

Your webpanel is now accessable on your `http:://serverip:30432` (replace 30432 with your Additional Port).

## [Vibegames](https://vibegames.com/)

You need to add an extra port in your control panel.

In the control panel, click on Network.

Inside our `config.json` now adjust your settings:

```
"port": "65348"
```

Your webpanel is now accessable on your `http:://serverip:65348` (replace 65348 with your new created allocation).

## General

We always offer the option, to run the webpanel on your FiveM Port. This option is often limited by your gameserver provider with Rating Limits (limiting requests).&#x20;

To use this option, you need to addjust your `externalHosting.js` file inside `unlimited-spectre/html/assets`

```
const e={backend:"/unlimited-spectre",base:"",webHistory:"/unlimited-spectre",isSubPath:"/unlimited-spectre",socketPath:"/unlimited-spectre/socket.io"};export{e};

```

Afterwards you can access your panel at:

`http://serverip:serverport/unlimited-spectre/`

{% hint style="info" %}
Replace `ulimited-spectre with your resource name!`
{% endhint %}
