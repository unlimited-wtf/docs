With our Drag-and-Drop function you can drag the rank where it belongs. \
By clicking the "Boss"-button you set the boss rank to a grade. \
This status is limited to one grade only. \


## Delete a Job

Select the job you like to delete and simply click "DELETE".

The Job and all its grades will be removed and deleted!\

**Beware:** Since you do the changes live on your server, deleting a job might can cause some troubles. If you delete a stash or garage you might delete items or avoid access to cars.
