We developed a function to grant a "boss"-status with instant ingame access on your specified boss menu. Furthermore you are now able to activate payment while off-duty and also the payment rates. You can also activate the default-duty option which effects players to be on-duty after login.&#x20;

You forgot to add a grade? No problem!\
With our Drag-and-Drop function you can drag the rank where it belongs! \


## Delete a Job

Select the job you like to delete and simply click "DELETE".

The Job and all its grades will be removed and deleted!\

**Beware:** Since you do the changes live on your server, deleting a job might can cause some troubles. Pay attention, that you only delete a job after some preparing for example to tell players to clear their storages. Otherwise players will loose all their stored items!
