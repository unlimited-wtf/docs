Setting Gang variables allows you to add gang-specific actionpoints like dealers, shops or other accesspoints only the gang can use.&#x20;

With our Drag-and-Drop function you can drag the rank where it belongs. \
By clicking the "Boss"-button you set the boss rank to a grade. \
This status is limited to one grade only.&#x20;

## Delete a Gang

Select the gang you like to delete and simply click "DELETE".

The gang and all its grades will be removed and deleted!\
\
**Beware:** Since you do the changes live on your server, deleting a job might can cause some troubles. If you delete a stash you might delete items of players.
