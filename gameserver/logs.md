| Dev       | All logs related to Development section of Spectre.                                           | Logs:Development |
| Web       | All web actions.                                                                              | Logs:Webpanel    |



## Integration

To integrade the Unlimited - Spectre logs to your scripts, use our server side exports:

```javascript
Valid types: ['info', 'error', 'warn', 'debug']
 
exports['unlimited-spectre']:GameLog(type, message) 
exports['unlimited-spectre']:PlayerLog(citizenId, type, message)

```

Player logs need the specific player identification (QBCore: citizenId) to get accepted and displayed in the player tab.\
